# EvilCookie

### What is Evil Cookie
An app where the user cracks open a fortune cookie to reveal an insult.

### Functionality
Once you get a fortune, you are then able to share it by clicking the paper airplane.

### How it works
The user repeatedly taps the screen to break the fortune cookie. Each tap switches the image to an image of a more cracked cookie. Once the cookie is cracked, two random adjectives and a noun are revealed. 1 in 100 times a special fortune is revealed.
